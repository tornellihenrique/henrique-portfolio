  "summary": "I'm a C++ Gameplay Programmer focused on Unreal Engine, with an emphasis on first-person feel, robust replication, and animation systems. My prototypes span a custom TrueFPS AnimGraph node (procedural aim-offset, sway, recoil, blocking, lean), replicated FPS game loops, spatial inventories, and advanced ballistics. I've also delivered a broad locomotion toolkit—ladders, parkour/zipline, swim, cover, grapple, and grappling-hook—built as Components/Interfaces so features slot cleanly into different projects. \n\nBefore specializing in gameplay, I worked across the full web stack (Java/Spring, Kafka, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GCP/AWS) and modern frontends (Angular/React/Ionic). That background shows up in how I structure systems: clear ownership, predictable network paths, and tooling-friendly code. Recent personal work includes FP/TP dual-mesh pipelines, UE5 retargeting for Manny/Metahumans, replicated weapons and attachments, and small matchflow/game-mode frameworks for testing features quickly.",
